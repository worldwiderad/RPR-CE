Wired up rpi3 and rpi4, enabled ssh
download repo to rpis via pip
rpi4 working, rpi 3 not, rpi 4 can recieve its own transmittions, but rpi3 cant do either
swich transmitters and recivers on rpis, still not working
checked code, nothing
swiched wires and transmitter, now rpi3 works and rpi4 does not
replaced wires for rpi4, working
rpi4 only recives transmitions sent by it's self, same w. rpi3.
Goes crazy
swiches the recivers so that the rpi3 reciver is beside the rpi4 transmitter and vice versa
now it is working
however, tryied putting them farther apart, bc of interferience
did not work
research
need antenna
